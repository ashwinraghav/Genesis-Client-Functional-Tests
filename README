This is a test suite for the genesis-2 client
Each test is organised into seperate Makefiles and directories. The naming of the directories should help figure what test it contains.
Each test has
1) Test Data setup
2) Test Run
3) Test Data Tear-Down

The global Makefile in the outermost directory will pick up any new tests if added and run all the tests.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Before Running the tests:
Download this git repo into the directory that contains the Genesis Binaries. This important.

Once downloaded, enter the Genesis-Client-Functional-Tests directory

1. In the Makefile, change the username to your-grid-user-name.
2. If you wish to change the mount-point, this can be done here as well (not changing this should not affect the test-run).

Run the following
#this will setup the fuse-mount directories
make setup
---------------------------------------------------------------
#run all tests
make test

A successful test run will be represented by ...... (dots)
Failures may be explicitly shown.

If a particular test is failing, navigate to the correct directory and run the particular test as follows

make test MOUNTED_HOME="../mount_point/home/your-grid-user-name" USER_NAME="your-grid-user-name"
